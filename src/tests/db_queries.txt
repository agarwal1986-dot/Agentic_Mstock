Quick Review Commands
- See your commit history:
git log --oneline
-- Compare changes with the previous commit:


--Branching: create a new brancha nd then push it 
git checkout -b feature/new-auth-flow
git push -u origin feature/new-auth-flow


to remove previous git
-- -- git rm --cached -r -f pytradingapi-typeB   ## if we need to remove any added file in git add
-- Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git   #### remoev current git setup , post this start from git init

******************* GIT Work Flow Branching Explained*********

 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Create a New Branch
git checkout -b feature-xyz


- checkout -b creates and switches to a new branch called feature-xyz.
- Think of this as starting a new "commit history line" from your current point.

2. Make Changes and Commit
# edit files
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature xyz"


- git add . stages all changes.
- git commit -m "message" saves them in the branch’s history.

3. Review Your Branch
- Use git log to see commits.
- Use git diff main..feature-xyz to compare changes between your branch and main.

4. Discard the Branch (if not needed)
git checkout main
git branch -d feature-xyz


- -d deletes the branch safely (only if merged).
- Use -D to force delete if you don’t want to keep it.

5. Merge Branch into Main
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz


- This integrates your branch’s commits into main.
- If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them before completing the merge.

6. Push to Remote (Optional)
git push origin feature-xyz


- This shares your branch with collaborators.
- After merging, you can also push main to update the remote repository.

🔄 Visualizing the Flow
- Start on main.
- Create feature-xyz.
- Commit changes there.
- Review differences.
- Either delete (discard) or merge back into main.

🚀 Best Practices
- Name branches clearly: e.g., bugfix/login-error or feature/dashboard-ui.
- Commit often: small, meaningful commits make review easier.
- Review before merging: use git diff or pull requests on platforms like GitHub.
- Delete merged branches: keeps repo clean.


**************** GIT Undo Options*******
🛠️ Undo Options in Git
1. Undo the last commit but keep changes (soft reset)
git reset --soft HEAD~1


- Removes the commit but keeps your changes staged.
- Useful if you just want to rewrite the commit message or adjust files before recommitting.

2. Undo the last commit and unstage changes (mixed reset)
git reset HEAD~1


- Removes the commit and unstages the changes.
- Your edits remain in the working directory, so you can re‑add and recommit.

3. Undo the last commit and discard changes (hard reset)
git reset --hard HEAD~1


- Completely removes the commit and discards all changes.
- ⚠️ Be careful: this is irreversible unless you know the commit hash.

4. Undo a commit that’s already pushed (safe way)
git revert <commit-hash>


- Creates a new commit that undoes the changes of the specified commit.
- This is the preferred way when working with shared repos, because it doesn’t rewrite history.

🔍 Example for Your Case
Since you just committed Update db_queries.txt with latest changes:
- If you haven’t pushed yet and want to completely remove it:
git reset --hard HEAD~1


- If you want to keep the changes but redo the commit:
git reset HEAD~1


- If you already pushed to GitHub and want to undo safely:
git revert ba16c6b

************ REBASE is better Option**********

Merge vs Rebase
- Merge
- Combines your branch into main with a new "merge commit".
- Keeps history intact (you see exactly when branches diverged and joined).
- Command:
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz
- Rebase
- Moves your branch commits on top of main as if they were made sequentially.
- Creates a cleaner, linear history.
- Command:
git checkout feature-xyz
git rebase main
- ⚠️ Use carefully if you’ve already pushed, since it rewrites history.

📦 Using Stash
Sometimes you’re mid‑work but need to switch branches without committing yet:
git stash


- Saves your changes temporarily.
- Switch branches, do other work.
- Restore later:
git stash pop



🧩 Typical Flow for a Feature
- Create branch → git checkout -b feature-xyz
- Commit changes → git add . && git commit -m "message"
- Push branch → git push origin feature-xyz
- Review (via pull request or git diff)
- Merge or rebase into main
- Delete branch → git branch -d feature-xyz
