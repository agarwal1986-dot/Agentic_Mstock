******************* GIT Work Flow Branching Explained*********

 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. Create a New Branch
git checkout -b feature-xyz


- checkout -b creates and switches to a new branch called feature-xyz.
- Think of this as starting a new "commit history line" from your current point.

2. Make Changes and Commit
# edit files
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature xyz"


- git add . stages all changes.
- git commit -m "message" saves them in the branch’s history.

3. Review Your Branch
- Use git log to see commits.
- Use git diff main..feature-xyz to compare changes between your branch and main.

4. Discard the Branch (if not needed)
git checkout main
git branch -d feature-xyz


- -d deletes the branch safely (only if merged).
- Use -D to force delete if you don’t want to keep it.

5. Merge Branch into Main
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz


- This integrates your branch’s commits into main.
- If there are conflicts, Git will ask you to resolve them before completing the merge.

6. Push to Remote (Optional)
git push origin feature-xyz


- This shares your branch with collaborators.
- After merging, you can also push main to update the remote repository.

🔄 Visualizing the Flow
- Start on main.
- Create feature-xyz.
- Commit changes there.
- Review differences.
- Either delete (discard) or merge back into main.

🚀 Best Practices
- Name branches clearly: e.g., bugfix/login-error or feature/dashboard-ui.
- Commit often: small, meaningful commits make review easier.
- Review before merging: use git diff or pull requests on platforms like GitHub.
- Delete merged branches: keeps repo clean.
